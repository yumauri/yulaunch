#summary Quick howto setup Opera to use with nonstandard protocols

For example, you want to start Putty when you click on ssh:// link.

1. Open Opera settings (Ctrl+F12)

2. Go to "Advanced" tab, and "Program" view

3. Add new "ssh" protocol and choose tool as application to open it

Next, setup yulaunch tool:

By default, configuration file are looked up near to binary yulaunch. And, if it cannot be found ­there – it will be looked up inside default setting path for your operation system (by default, it is _C:\Documents and Settings\user\Local Settings\Application Data\yulaunch\yulaunch.cfg_ for Windows, and _/home/user/.config/yulaunch.cfg_ for Linux).

Put `[ssh]` section inside configuration file, and point 'command' line to your Putty instance:
{{{
[ssh]
command = putty.exe "%1"
}}}
Instead of "%1" there will be placed your link, without "ssh://" prefix.
