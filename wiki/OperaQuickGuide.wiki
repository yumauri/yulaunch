== yulaunch setup ==

By default, configuration file are looked up near to binary yulaunch. And, if it cannot be found ­there – it will be looked up inside default setting path for your operation system (by default, it is _C:\Documents and Settings\user\Local Settings\Application Data\yulaunch\yulaunch.cfg_ for Windows, and _/home/user/.config/yulaunch.cfg_ for Linux).

Put `[ssh]` section inside configuration file, and point 'command' line to your Putty instance:
{{{
[ssh]
command = putty.exe "%1"
}}}
Instead of "%1" there will be placed your link, without "ssh://" prefix.

== Thats all ==

You can try to create page with link to ssh://your-server-name/ and click by.
