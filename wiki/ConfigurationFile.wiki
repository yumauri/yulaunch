= Details =

You can specify a little more properties for protocol, here they are:

=== spacer ===
If you program requires more than one parameter, you can use separator in the link, for example, if you need port in addition to server address, you can setup protocol as
{{{
[ssh]
command = putty.exe -P %2 "%1"
spacer = |
}}}
and use link ssh://127.0.0.1|2202

As you can see, you can use %1, %2 etc to access to the parts, separated by delimeter. Also, you can use variable names
{{{
[ssh]
command = putty.exe -P %port "%1"
spacer = |
}}}
and use link ssh://127.0.0.1|port=2202

In last example variables will be:<br>
 %1 → 127.0.0.1<br>
 %2 → port=2202<br>
 %port → 2202
